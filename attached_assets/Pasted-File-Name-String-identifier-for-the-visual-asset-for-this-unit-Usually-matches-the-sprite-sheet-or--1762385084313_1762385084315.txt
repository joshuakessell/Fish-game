File Name
String identifier for the visual asset for this unit.
Usually matches the sprite sheet or texture file on disk (for example dragon_king.png). Used to load graphics.

Type ID
Integer primary key for the unit.
Unique per row. Safe to use as the canonical ID in code, network messages, and save data.

Fish Name
Human readable display name for the unit.
Shown in UI, logs, and debugging tools. Not required to be unique, but uniqueness is helpful.

Description
Short text explaining how this unit behaves in gameplay.
Gives design intent such as size, rarity, and tactical notes. The LLM should not parse it mechanically, but can use it to auto generate tooltips or documentation.

Appearance Frequency
Describes how often this unit should appear on screen.
Can be expressed either as a qualitative tag (Common, Rare, Always (1 active at all times)) or as a rough percentage string (15%). The game logic should convert this into spawn weights or constraints, for example enforcing that at least one Special Item and one Boss Fish are present while their events are not running.

Base Reward Value
Low level numeric reward used for tuning.
Represents the core value of killing this unit before multipliers or special bonuses. The LLM can use it when computing score displays, coin popups, or jackpot contributions.

Kill Animation
Descriptor of the short, local animation that plays when the final hit is applied.
Covers simple effects such as spin, flash, bubbles, or small shake. This animation happens at the unit position and usually lasts under one second. It is separate from global or extended events.

Fish Type
Category label that drives core balance logic. One of:

Small Fish: 2x to 10x payout. High capture probability. Common targets.

Medium Fish: 12x to 20x payout. Moderate capture probability.

Large Fish: 30x to 80x payout. Low capture probability. High HP feeling.

High-Value Fish: 100x to 150x payout. Very low capture probability. Mini boss style.

Special Items: 20x to 40x payout plus a power up or event. Exactly one should be active when no special event is running.

Boss Fish: 100x to 500x payout. Triggers a large scale event. Exactly one should be active when no boss event is running.

The LLM should use this field to choose HP, hit feedback, and AI behavior templates.

Payout Multiplier
Multiplier applied to the player bet or shot cost when this unit is killed.
Example: if the shot cost is 1 credit and the multiplier is 40, the kill awards 40 credits, not counting side effects from events. This field is central to RTP tuning.

Capture Probability
Per shot probability that a hit on this unit results in a kill.
Used in the hit resolution formula. The Expected Value is defined as Capture Probability * Payout Multiplier. After global scaling, the average of Expected Value across all rows is about 0.95 to enforce 95 percent RTP.

Death Sequence
Short textual description of what happens visually when the unit is destroyed.
For normal fish this may be None or a simple line. For Special Items and Boss Fish this can mention the immediate VFX and SFX, but not the full extended behavior. Use it to script animation timelines or to drive state machines.

Extended Death Behavior
High level description of the multi step event that follows the death of a Special Item or Boss Fish.
This includes duration, how it interacts with other fish, how coins are generated, and when the game is allowed to respawn a new Special Item or Boss Fish.
Rules for LLM or engine:

While an Extended Death Behavior is running for a Special Item, do not spawn another Special Item.

While an Extended Death Behavior is running for a Boss Fish, do not spawn another Boss Fish.

After the extended event finishes, restore the invariant that at least one Special Item and at least one Boss Fish are present on screen, subject to your spawn pacing.

Expected Value
Computed helper field.
Expected Value = Capture Probability * Payout Multiplier for this unit.
The engine does not need to store it, but the LLM can use it to verify that the average across all rows stays near the target RTP (about 0.95 credits returned per credit bet) after any further tuning.
