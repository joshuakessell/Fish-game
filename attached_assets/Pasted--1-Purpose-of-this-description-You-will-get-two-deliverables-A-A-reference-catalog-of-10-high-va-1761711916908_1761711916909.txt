	1.	Purpose of this description
You will get two deliverables.

A. A reference catalog of 10 high-value exotic targets (from common fish-table patterns). For each:
	•	How it moves
	•	How often it appears
	•	How hard it is to kill
	•	What happens if you land the kill shot
	•	How payout is calculated
	•	Why players care about it

B. A synthesis model.
You will see design rules that link all exotic targets.
These rules let another model invent new exotic targets, including meme-based / pop-culture parodies.
The invented targets must match gameplay balance.
They must preserve an operator RTP near 90 percent long-term.

Then I will generate 10 new exotic fish with full detail using those rules.

SECTION A. 10 COMMON EXOTIC TARGET ARCHETYPES
These are not exact copyrighted characters. They represent the functional roles used by bosses and specials across known fish table games.

For each entry:
	•	Name / Theme
	•	Screen Behavior
	•	Spawn Frequency
	•	Kill Difficulty
	•	Kill Reward Logic
	•	Kill Sequence / Animation
	•	RTP Note

	1.	Bomb Crab
Screen Behavior
Slow, mid-size crab carrying visible bombs. Moves in a lazy horizontal path across mid-screen. Does not flee fast.
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon. Roughly 1 Bomb Crab per 30 to 60 seconds of play. Often 1 on screen at a time.
Kill Difficulty
Moderate. Health is higher than a normal fish. Low-power shots struggle. High-power shots kill it faster.
Kill Reward Logic
This unit is a “multiplier via cascade.” When killed, it explodes and wipes nearby fish in a radius. Player who killed it gets full credit values of each fish destroyed in the blast.
Kill Sequence / Animation
Crab flashes red. Screen pops with 1 to 3 bomb shockwaves. Each shockwave is a circular blast that vaporizes surrounding fish with small score popups everywhere.
RTP Note
This is an area-clear bonus. Expected payout is controlled by the radius, typical surrounding fish values, and cap on total fish it is allowed to wipe. The average return from killing a Bomb Crab must be less than or equal to the total cost of ammo typically spent trying to kill it plus what would normally be earned in that same time. The engine can cap max blast hits so it cannot overpay.
	2.	Drill Crab
Screen Behavior
Heavily armored crab with a drill strapped on. Moves slowly along a curved path, often toward center.
Spawn Frequency
Rare. Maybe 1 per 2 minutes.
Kill Difficulty
High. Requires focused fire or high-cost shots. Competes for attention from all players.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, launches a guided drill projectile that tunnels through fish for a short duration, then detonates in an AOE. All fish hit during tunneling and final blast pay out to the killer.
Kill Sequence / Animation
A spinning drill rockets outward, carving a glowing trail. Fish along that path auto-die with metallic impact effects. Then a final detonation wipes a pocket of fish like a localized nuke.
RTP Note
This is a line-clear plus mini AOE. The drill duration and number of fish it is allowed to pierce are hard-capped. That guarantees predictable EV.
	3.	Laser Crab
Screen Behavior
Crab with a glowing energy core. Moves slowly but hugs bottom or edges.
Spawn Frequency
Rare. Similar rarity to Drill Crab.
Kill Difficulty
Medium-high. Similar to Drill Crab but slightly easier.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, the player gets 1 stored laser shot. The laser shot is a full-screen beam that instantly kills anything along its aim line. The player chooses when to fire it. Only kills from that beam pay to that player.
Kill Sequence / Animation
When killed, camera flashes. UI shows “LASER READY.” When fired later: the player cannon charges, then a huge beam sweeps across the screen, slicing fish in a straight line.
RTP Note
This is delayed value. The player can aim the beam at clusters or bosses. To control EV, limit the beam width, limit how long you can store it, and limit how often high-value targets overlap with the beam.
	4.	Lightning Eel / Lightning Fish
Screen Behavior
Long eel or electric jellyfish swimming gracefully through mid-screen in arcs.
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon. Perhaps every 45 seconds. Sometimes two at once.
Kill Difficulty
Medium. Easier than Drill Crab.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, chain lightning jumps to several other fish one after another. Each chained fish is auto-killed and pays out. The chain length has a hard maximum.
Kill Sequence / Animation
After kill, the eel bursts into lightning. Bolts rapidly zig-zag to nearby fish, tagging them with electric effects. Each tagged fish explodes into score.
RTP Note
This is a “multi-kill chain.” EV is governed by max chain count and which fish are eligible. For example, chain might skip bosses or very high-value fish.
	5.	Vortex Starfish / Whirlpool Octopus
Screen Behavior
Floats near center slowly, pulsing.
Spawn Frequency
Rare. ~1 per 2 to 4 minutes.
Kill Difficulty
High. It tends to drift in busy areas where many bullets are flying, so everyone contests it.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, creates a whirlpool that pulls in fish from a certain radius or of a certain class (for example, all small fish currently on screen). All those fish die and credit the killer.
Kill Sequence / Animation
Spiral effect grows. Fish are dragged inward along curved paths, then vanish into a collapsing vortex with score bursts.
RTP Note
This is an “AOE harvest by pull.” Cap the number and class of fish affected, or apply diminishing payout for fish after the first N to keep predictable EV.
	6.	Roulette Crab
Screen Behavior
Medium-speed, flashy crab with casino motifs. Moves in a wave pattern to draw attention.
Spawn Frequency
Rare. ~1 per few minutes. Usually only one active.
Kill Difficulty
Medium. Its health is not insane because the real payout is behind a minigame.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, the player who landed final blow is taken into a one-player bonus round (roulette wheel / prize wheel / pick-a-chest UI). This does not pause gameplay for others. The bonus mini-round awards a lump sum or multiplier.
Kill Sequence / Animation
Roulette wheel overlay appears for that player only. The wheel spins with jackpot values, multipliers, or named prizes. After a few seconds the wheel stops and awards a bonus.
RTP Note
This is a discrete bonus event. The wheel probabilities are tuned so long-term average payout is fixed. Operator can adjust those tables to maintain a target hold. The core round rarely overpays relative to ammo burnt trying to secure the crab.
	7.	Boss Dragon (Golden Dragon / Fire Dragon archetype)
Screen Behavior
Huge dragon swims/floats across the midline, sometimes in figure-eight or slow sweeping S-curves. Stays on screen briefly. Draws aggro from all players instantly.
Spawn Frequency
Very rare. Possibly once per round or phase.
Kill Difficulty
Extreme. Very high health. Often requires sustained concentrated fire or a finishing snipe at the last second.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, the dragon triggers a boss wipe: breathes fire or explodes, wiping most fish on screen and converting them into points for the killer. May also drop a super bonus payout directly (jackpot-like).
Kill Sequence / Animation
Cinematic. The dragon roars, unleashes multi-stage fire waves that sweep across the entire playfield, then detonates in a screen-whiteout. After the flash, every fish vanishes and the killer’s score jumps.
RTP Note
This is a round climax. Payout spikes hard but appears very rarely and is very costly to secure. The appearance frequency and boss HP let you budget the expected value per minute so the table’s overall RTP stays ~90 percent.
	8.	Colossal Beast (Giant Gator / King Crab / Kaiju Ape archetype)
Screen Behavior
Massive creature that crawls or swims slowly along the bottom foreground or top foreground, partially obscuring view. It feels like a mini-boss.
Spawn Frequency
Rare but more frequent than the Dragon. Could appear once every 60 to 90 seconds in later rounds.
Kill Difficulty
High. Takes focused attention but not as insane as Dragon.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, the beast slams or thrashes, causing localized shockwaves in multiple zones. Each shockwave kills fish in that zone and pays the killer. Compared to Dragon, this is more “multi-zone AOE” than full wipe.
Kill Sequence / Animation
Camera shake. Beast animation plays (tail whip, claw slam, tentacles, hammer fist). Several radial blasts detonate in different map sectors. Each blast converts fish into payouts.
RTP Note
This is “sector clears.” The number of zones and radius per zone govern EV.
	9.	Phoenix / Mythic Bird archetype
Screen Behavior
Fast, bright, high-contrast flying creature. Moves in arcs and loops, not straight lines. Often leaves glowing feathers. Hard to track.
Spawn Frequency
Very rare and time-limited. Often appears only for a few seconds then attempts to flee.
Kill Difficulty
High aim skill required because it is fast.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, triggers a resurrection burst. The bird “rebirths” into a shower of flaming feathers. Each feather turns nearby fish into instant payouts or spawns a wave of high-value fish that only the killer can collect for a short personal frenzy window.
Kill Sequence / Animation
Bird ignites, explodes into flaming feathers. Feathers rain down and cause mini-explosions or spawn golden fish around the killer’s reticle. Killer enjoys a short boosted scoring window. Other players keep playing normally.
RTP Note
This is a timed “solo frenzy.” EV is limited by short duration (for example 5 seconds) and target caps.
	10.	Jackpot Carrier / Treasure Sub / King Chest archetype
Screen Behavior
Large slow-moving treasure-carrying entity. Could be a giant turtle with a vault on its back or a submarine dragging treasure pods.
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon mid-boss tier. More frequent than Dragon but less frequent than Bomb Crab.
Kill Difficulty
Medium-high. It soaks hits but moves slowly so most players can hit it.
Kill Reward Logic
On kill, it “drops chests.” Each chest pops open and reveals fixed bonus values or “pick one of three chests” style sub-minigames. All payouts go only to the killer.
Kill Sequence / Animation
The creature cracks apart, releasing chests that float up. The killer gets UI prompts to open them (either automatically or interactively). Chests burst into coins or gems that fly to the killer’s score counter.
RTP Note
This is loot distribution. You can cap total loot per kill, and you can weight chest rewards with a known table that preserves average return.

Shared traits and design rules across all exotic targets
These bosses / specials all follow a few consistent rules. These rules are how another language model should generalize them and invent new ones:
	1.	Rarity vs Payout
The rarer the creature, the bigger the possible swing.

	•	Common special (Bomb Crab): appears often, yields moderate multi-kill value in a localized area.
	•	Ultra-rare boss (Dragon): appears rarely, yields a near screen wipe or jackpot tier payout.

	2.	Contest Behavior
They almost always create a contest moment.

	•	They are obvious. They are flashy. They move in patterns that draw attention.
	•	Multiple players race to land the kill shot.
	•	Only the killer gets the reward.

	3.	Kill Shot Ownership
All rewards from the effect go to the killer alone.
Even if other players did 90 percent of the damage, the finisher gets paid.
This drives “sniping” behavior and competitive tension.
	4.	After-Death Conversion
On kill, something dramatic happens that “converts” fish or spawns value. Main conversion patterns:

	•	Area of Effect clear (Bomb Crab, Colossal Beast shockwaves)
	•	Line clear (Laser Crab beam, Drill Crab tunneling)
	•	Chain / jump effect (Lightning Fish chaining)
	•	Pull / gather / compress then cash out (Vortex fish)
	•	Personal bonus minigame (Roulette Crab, Jackpot Carrier)
	•	Global or near-global wipe (Dragon)
	•	Timed mode where you alone get boosted farming (Phoenix frenzy window)

	5.	Visual Identity
Each exotic target is visually distinct and obviously special. Often oversized. Often themed (dragon, bomb crab, roulette crab).
The animation after death is huge, screen-dominating, with bright particle spam, camera shake, slow-mo flashes, etc.
	6.	RTP Governance
Even though effects look wild, final expected value is bounded.
The system caps:

	•	Radius of blast
	•	Number of fish chain lightning will jump to
	•	Duration of frenzy windows
	•	Values in roulette tables
	•	Zones covered by boss wipes
	•	Frequency of appearance
The operator can tune these caps and frequencies so total average payout to players over time is ~90 percent of total wagered credits (target RTP 90 percent).
This tuning happens across minutes of play, not per single kill.
In other words, individual kills can spike above 90 percent but the long-run average over many appearances is controlled.

	7.	Thematic Reskinning
The core mechanic can be re-skinned as any creature.
Example: “Bomb Crab explosion AOE” can be reskinned as “King Kong ground slam shockwave,” “giant gator tail whip,” “Hulk smash,” etc.
The animation wrapper changes, but the mechanic class (AOE clear, line clear, chain lightning, vortex pull, timed frenzy, loot chests, roulette spin, global wipe) repeats.
This means we can create new exotic fish using new pop culture parodies or memes by mapping them to one of these mechanic classes or combining two in a controlled way, while still capping payout contribution.

This is the template another language model should learn:
	•	Pick a theme
	•	Pick a movement pattern that feels consistent with that theme
	•	Pick an on-death conversion mechanic from the known classes above (or a safe hybrid of two)
	•	Specify rarity, kill difficulty, payout structure, and visual sequence
	•	Keep EV bounded and tuneable

SECTION B. 10 NEW EXOTIC TARGETS FOR THIS GAME
These are original designs using the rules above. Each includes:
	•	Spawn Frequency (rarity)
	•	Kill Difficulty
	•	Movement Pattern
	•	Kill Effect Class
	•	Kill Sequence / Animation
	•	Payout Logic and RTP Control

Assume target RTP of 90 percent over time. That means that although a single kill might award a burst of value, all spawn rates and caps are tuned so that if players spend 100 credits firing at these over a long period, on average they get ~90 credits back.
	1.	Crypto Whale
Spawn Frequency
Very rare. About once every 3 minutes.
Kill Difficulty
High health and moves unpredictably.
Movement Pattern
Large glowing whale that “pivots” sharp angles like it’s glitching. Teleports short distances, leaving pixel trails.
Kill Effect Class
Jackpot Carrier / Loot Drop.
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the whale “bursts” into floating crypto coins and USB-stick vaults. 3 to 5 vaults hover on screen for the killer. Each vault auto-opens and sprays value icons into the player’s score meter.
Payout Logic
Each vault has a weighted table: common low reward, rare high reward. Total vault payout per kill is capped.
RTP Control
Spawn is rare and kill is expensive in ammo. Weighted tables ensure average vault sum is balanced to maintain long-term 90 percent RTP.
	2.	Reality TV Shark
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon mid-boss. About once per minute in later rounds.
Kill Difficulty
Medium-high health. Slow swimmer across center, shows off, wiggles.
Movement Pattern
Slow S-curve with pauses like “posing for the camera.” Easy to aim at but takes a lot of hits.
Kill Effect Class
Roulette / Bonus Wheel.
Kill Sequence / Animation
When killed, the screen for the killer cuts to a fake “pitch meeting.” A spinning “Deal or No Deal” style board flips through multipliers and instant-cash awards. It stops on one.
Payout Logic
Result is a single lump sum (credits or points). Wheel odds are pre-tuned.
RTP Control
This can produce spikes but average outcome across many spins sits under the expected ammo cost to secure kills.
	3.	Dumpster Kraken
Spawn Frequency
Rare. 1 every 2 minutes.
Kill Difficulty
High. Tentacles swat away bullets visually.
Movement Pattern
Swims low, then anchors in place and waves tentacles. Stationary phase creates a high-DPS opportunity for players to pour shots in.
Kill Effect Class
AOE Pull (Vortex).
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the Kraken collapses into a swirling garbage whirlpool. The whirlpool sucks in every small and medium fish on screen into a spinning trash vortex, then compacts them into scrap, awarding all their value to the killer.
Payout Logic
Cap the number of fish pulled. Bosses and other specials are immune.
RTP Control
Because it can sweep many midsize fish, you strictly cap the fish count pulled and also limit Kraken frequency.
	4.	Influencer Jelly
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon. Maybe once a minute.
Kill Difficulty
Medium. Low health but fast drifting zigzag with sparkle trail.
Movement Pattern
Erratic zigzag across upper half of screen, leaving glitter hearts or “likes.”
Kill Effect Class
Chain Lightning.
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the Jelly “goes viral.” Bursts into a wave of neon hearts that rapidly jump to nearby fish, “tagging” them. Tagged fish pop into likes and vanish, crediting the killer.
Payout Logic
Chain length is capped (for example max 8 fish). Low-value fish are always eligible. High-value and bosses are excluded.
RTP Control
Cap chain length and eligible fish value to stabilize EV.
	5.	Nuclear Lobster
Spawn Frequency
Very rare. ~1 every 4 minutes.
Kill Difficulty
Extreme. Huge health pool.
Movement Pattern
Slow crawl along bottom edge, glowing red-hot.
Kill Effect Class
Screen / Sector Wipe Hybrid.
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the lobster overloads and detonates in 3 sequential sector blasts: left side, mid, right side of the map. Each blast nukes everything in that sector. Camera shakes. Siren audio.
Payout Logic
Each sector blast has a max fish count and ignores elite bosses. All killed fish pay to the killer.
RTP Control
The 3-blast pattern looks like a near full wipe but is actually limited by per-sector caps. Spawn frequency and high ammo sink keep long-term EV in line.
	6.	Jackpot UFO
Spawn Frequency
Rare but visible. About once per 90 seconds.
Kill Difficulty
Medium-high. Shield flickers.
Movement Pattern
Circular hovering path around the center with sudden darts outward like a saucer scanning abductees.
Kill Effect Class
Timed Solo Frenzy (Phoenix-style).
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, a beam abducts the killer’s cannon UI into “UFO Mode” for 5 seconds. During UFO Mode, that player’s shots cost no credits and auto-stun most fish for instant capture. Other players continue normal play.
Payout Logic
During frenzy window, every fish the killer taps is instant kill with a flat per-fish payout.
RTP Control
Short duration window and per-fish payout cap keep total expected gain predictable. Spawn rate of UFO adjusts difficulty across the session.
	7.	Meme Gator
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon. ~1 per minute.
Kill Difficulty
Medium. Big hitbox but swims semi-fast in a lazy curve, tail swiping.
Movement Pattern
Low/mid horizontal glide with tail flicks that knock away small fish visually.
Kill Effect Class
Line Clear (Drill / Laser style).
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the gator tail whips so hard it creates a shockwave line across the whole screen. That shockwave slices through everything along that horizontal line and those fish get caught instantly.
Payout Logic
All fish in that slice are awarded to the killer.
RTP Control
Limit the width of the slice to a narrow band and ignore high-tier bosses. Prevents uncontrolled jackpots.
	8.	Party Volcano Turtle
Spawn Frequency
Rare mid-boss. 1 every 2 minutes once rounds get harder.
Kill Difficulty
High. Moves slowly, heavily armored.
Movement Pattern
Crawls diagonally, spewing lava bubbles (cosmetic) that distract aim.
Kill Effect Class
Loot Drop + Cluster AOE.
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the shell blows open like a volcano. A ring of mini-eruptions appears around the map. Each eruption both wipes a small local cluster of fish and drops a “treasure geode.”
The killer then cracks 1 to 3 geodes (auto-open or click to open) for extra payout.
Payout Logic
Each geode uses a weighted reward table (similar to chest drops or mini roulette).
RTP Control
Cap number of eruptions and number/value of geodes.
	9.	Copyright Lawyer Squid
Spawn Frequency
Uncommon, but can stack. ~every 45 seconds.
Kill Difficulty
Low-medium health, but constantly waves its tentacles as if serving papers to block shots as VFX.
Movement Pattern
Floats toward nearest cluster of other special fish, “harassing” them.
Kill Effect Class
Single-Target Snipe Bonus.
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, the squid “sues” your target of choice. The killer immediately gets to “claim rights” to one currently-alive high-value fish. That chosen fish instantly dies and pays out to the killer, even if someone else was shooting it.
Implementation detail: server picks one eligible high-value fish currently alive and awards it to the killer.
Payout Logic
Award is capped by a max-value fish list. Boss-tier entities like Dragon are excluded.
RTP Control
Because payout is deterministic and limited to a capped list of eligible fish, EV per Lawyer Squid kill is stable.
	10.	Time Thief Puffer
Spawn Frequency
Common special. ~every 30 seconds.
Kill Difficulty
Low-medium. Easy to pop, but tiny hitbox.
Movement Pattern
Small, jittery pufferfish that balloons and shrinks erratically and darts around.
Kill Effect Class
Micro Time Slow.
Kill Sequence / Animation
On kill, time “slows” for the killer for 2 seconds in their local view. Fish movement appears slowed, aim reticle highlights targets, and all shots from that player hit with boosted accuracy during that window. Other players see normal speed.
In engine terms this is not true global slowdown. It is a per-player aim assist and hit boost.
Payout Logic
During slow window, the killer’s shots have temporarily increased killChance or damage so they can pick off 2 to 4 extra fish easily.
RTP Control
Short window, capped fish count, modest fish tiers only.

How to keep RTP near 90 percent using these new designs
	•	Each exotic is paired with a cost to kill (ammo spent by players) and an expected reward.
	•	You control expected reward by capping:
	•	Max fish affected by AOE / chain / slice
	•	Duration of frenzy windows
	•	Loot table values in chest / vault / roulette outcomes
	•	Eligibility list for instant-claim effects
	•	Frequency of spawn
	•	Health (how much ammo you must burn to secure kill)
	•	You also control spawn frequency dynamically. If table payout (total out) starts drifting too high vs total bullets spent (total in), reduce spawn rate for high-paying specials or reduce their cap values.
	•	If the table is running “cold,” increase the soft-cap slightly or spawn a higher-value exotic a bit sooner.
	•	Because only the final shot gets paid, the table leaks less value than naive shared-credit systems. The kill-shot rule is itself a margin protection tool.

How another model should now design new exotic fish
Process for new exotic design:
	1.	Pick a recognizable or humorous theme (for example a viral meme animal, a parody “CEO Shark,” a “Robot Influencer Cat,” etc.). The model can web search current memes or cultural references to pick something players will instantly get.
	2.	Assign movement and on-screen personality that matches the theme.
	•	UFO → hovering circles and sudden darts
	•	Influencer → zigzag sparkle trail
	•	Kaiju → stomps or sweeps across bottom
	3.	Assign an on-death conversion mechanic from the known classes or a safe hybrid (AOE blast, chain lightning, time-limited personal frenzy, loot chests, roulette spin, instant-claim, etc.).
	4.	Set rarity (spawn frequency) and kill difficulty (health, evasiveness).
	5.	Define payout logic in a way that can be bounded.
	•	Area clears have radius caps
	•	Chain lightning has max hops
	•	Frenzy windows have time caps
	•	Roulette / loot drops pull from weighted tables
	6.	Add a signature kill animation that is dramatic and readable.
	7.	Explicitly state how EV is controlled to keep system RTP around 90 percent over time, not per event.

The 10 new exotic targets above (Crypto Whale, Reality TV Shark, Dumpster Kraken, Influencer Jelly, Nuclear Lobster, Jackpot UFO, Meme Gator, Party Volcano Turtle, Copyright Lawyer Squid, Time Thief Puffer) are examples produced by following that process.

They demonstrate:
	•	Unique theming
	•	Distinct movement patterns
	•	Distinct kill reward mechanics
	•	Explicit caps or windows for payout
	•	Clear rarity and cost-to-kill assumptions
	•	Built-in levers for RTP management

A second language model can now:
	•	Swap the theming (e.g. “Crypto Whale” to “Stonks Bull,” “Reality TV Shark” to “Stream Drama Orca”)
	•	Change visuals and animations
	•	Keep the mechanic class (loot drop, roulette bonus, vortex pull, chain lightning, timed frenzy, instant-claim, etc.)
	•	Adjust rarity and payout tables
	•	Guarantee that long-run EV stays controlled by giving each special a hard ceiling on how many fish / how much bonus / how long the frenzy lasts.

That is the blueprint for scalable exotic bosses and specials that feel fresh, meme-aware, and high-drama while keeping operator-side control of hold percentage.
